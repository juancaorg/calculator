# Calculator

A simple Calculator app built with vanilla JavaScript.

## Description

- Calculate arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `Ã—` and `Ã·`.
- Mobile responsive.

**20220601 note:** I tested this on iOS Safari and the `Ã·` and `=` buttons seem off for some reason, but testing the responsiveness on Desktop seems to be working fine ðŸ¤”.

I'll fix that later, maybe. Probably not, idk.
